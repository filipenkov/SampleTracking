<!--
This file holds details of all the upgrades for JIRA

There is no longer a concept of editions since JIRA 4.x and hence all upgrade tasks
should be placed in this file.

The makeup of this XML file is described here :

<upgrades> The root node of the file. Everything should be contained within this node
    <upgrade> Each upgrade element describes an upgrade task.
        Attributes
        1. build -  This defines the build that the upgrade applies to
        2. setup -  This determines if the upgrade should be run as part of the SetupComplete task.

                    Set to "true" if this should be run as part of setup as well as general upgrade paths.
                    Set to "only" means the upgrade will ONLY be run on clean setup instances and never on general upgrade paths
                    Set to "false" or omitted means the task will be run only on general upgrade paths

        <class> The class element defines the name of the class which performs the upgrade
-->

    <!--
       This is a migration from an old professional specific upgrade task which names
         clashed with 1.2 so we have invented a build number so that it it will run but
         we can keep the same tests in place and so forth
