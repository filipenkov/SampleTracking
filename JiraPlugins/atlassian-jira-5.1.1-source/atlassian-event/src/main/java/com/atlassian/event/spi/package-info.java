/**
 * <p>This package contains SPI interfaces applications can implement to <em>customise</em> their event listeners.</p>
 * <p>Application code should not depend directly on those interfaces. They should only be referenced for implementation
 * and in their IoC container configuration.</p>
 *
 * <p>Some implementation of those interfaces are provided as part of the {@link com.atlassian.event.internal} package.
 * Please read this package documentation and source code for more information on how to implement those interfaces.</p>
